# TickIt - Backend - Python / Flask

## Description / Requirements

TickIt is a fully functional to-do list application, with the ability to create, update and delete to-do entries, as well as the ability to "tickit" off and mark the task as completed. The application was built using a React TypeScript frontend, with a Python Flask backend and a MySQL database. This project is a spin-off of my java-springboot project, to practice using Python and Flask

With this project, the plan was to practice and implement how to:

- Create and implement all parts of a functional fullstack application. 
- Use Flask to act as a backend between a MySQL database and a React TypeScript frontend.
- Use React TypeScript as a frontend framework.
- Handle errors in both the front and backends correctly and efficiently.
- Perform CRUD operations in a fullstack format.
- Integrate React-Testing Library to test the frontend functionality. 

Project Requirements:

Create a backend with Flask that can create, update, read and delete todos from a MySQL database. Along with this create a frontend application with React that interacts with this backend.

Frontend:

- Ability to add, complete, delete and edit to-dos
- Typescript & testing with React Test Library
- All errors must be handled and passed on properly back to the user (toast notifications are a good way of doing this)
- Must look polished, there is an example image attached to this spec and there are hundreds of examples of good looking todo apps online

## Design Goals / Approach

- I wanted the application to function as expected, with complete CRUD operations from the frontend to database.
- Correct and efficient error-handling, so that the application can run and function as required.

---

## Features

- **Create Entries:** Ability to create a to-entry.
- **Update and Delete:** Ability to update and delete to-do entries.
- **Error-Handling:** Errors return the correct status and messages back to the user.

## Technologies:

- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **MySQL**

---

## Future Goals

- Search feature
- More in-depth sort and filtering systems
- Add categories to the entries
- User Authentication
- Deploy application
